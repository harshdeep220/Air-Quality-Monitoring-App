# Air Quality Monitoring System 🌍

This project is an **IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring System** designed to measure real-time environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, gas levels, and particulate matter (PM2.5). The system utilizes advanced sensors to collect data, which is then stored, analyzed, and visualized using the **ThingSpeak** platform and a mobile app interface. The goal is to enhance awareness of air pollution and enable proactive solutions.
